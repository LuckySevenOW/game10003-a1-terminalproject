# game10003-a1-terminalproject

Welcome! I'm Jake Kielty, and this is my text-based adventure game made for the GAME10003 Terminal Project.

In this game, you play as a Space Marine of the Dark Angels chapter from the tabletop strategy game franchise, Warhammer: 40,000, and must choose wisely to accomplish your mission of assassinating a Necron Overlord inside of his tomb.
A short primer is included at the start, so don't worry if you aren't familiar with the world of Warhammer 40,000! 

How to Play:

Enter your name and years served - These can be whatever you choose, and are not case sensitive.

Options - Choose one of the options given, shown with quotations around them, and write your decision below. These answers are CASE-SENSITIVE. 

There are multiple paths with different ways to succeed! If you don't succeed at first, try another path and see what happens!
